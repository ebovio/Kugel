# Kugel

---------------------------------------
This is a game in which you become this round pal, Kugel.
He is native to a distant planet full of round objects and people.

One day, while he was travelling close to a nearby planet, an accident occurred and he had no option but to land on this stranger planet.

Kugel soon realized that this planet was nothing like his home: everything was square! And to make it even harsher, his abilities were missing!
He has no way of coming back home...for now.

You must help Kugel find all of his lost abilities in order for him to be able to leave this weird world and return to his home planet.
